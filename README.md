This repository contains my professional web design portfolio showcasing 
live, responsive websites I’ve developed using HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages. 

Projects include multi-page designs with modern layouts, responsive design 
for mobile and desktop, and interactive elements like navigation bars, 
image galleries, and hover animations. 

Live project links are included to demonstrate real-world web design skills 
and client-ready websites.
